      Iâ€™m a mostly shooting street photography although my goal for the next
      year is to familiarize myself with portraits. My initial interest in
      photography came from when I bought a camera two years ago specifically
      for a trip in Iceland. Then the camera collected dust on a shelf... until
      last Fall when I decided to dive in and take photography as a serious
      hobby.

      When I go out to shoot Iâ€™m always craving for a good light or a good story
      to tell through my lens. Photography allows me to express my creativity in
      a way that my day job can't and it feeds my curiosity towards human
      interactions.

      I'm a software developer doing web development. I'm skilled in Javascript
      <i>â€”Angular, Node</i>, reactive programming <i>â€”RxJS</i>, databases
      <i>SQL, NoSQL</i> and HTML & CSS and I like clean code and unit
      testing. The two main reasons why I love programming so much are that it puts me
      into an environment of constant learning and that it always challenges my problem
      solving skills <i>(INTJ here ðŸ‘‹)</i>.
